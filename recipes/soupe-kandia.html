                    The dish is cooked in a large pot, with the vegetables and meat being saut√©ed in oil before being simmered in water. The fish is typically added towards the end of the cooking process to prevent it from overcooking. The dish is seasoned with a variety of spices, including black pepper, curmin and coriander.
