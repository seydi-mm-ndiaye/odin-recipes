# odin-recipes

This mini project is the first assignment on Odin project. 

The aim is to review the whole HTML aspects seen during the introductory course. 

Basically, we built a simple website allowing one to choose in a list of recipes and then to get as result informations pertaining to that recipe(image, description, ingredients, steps for preparation).
