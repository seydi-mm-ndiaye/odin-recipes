# odin-recipes

This mini project is the first assignment on Odin project. 

The aim is to review the whole HTML aspects seen during the introductory course. 

Basically, we built a simple website allowing one to choose in a list of recipes and then to get as result informations pertaining to that recipe(image, description, ingredients, steps for preparation).  

For now, it just contains one recipe but more will be added later.
